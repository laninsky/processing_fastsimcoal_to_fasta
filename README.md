# processing_fastsimcoal_to_fasta
Taking the concatenated arlequin file from fastsimcoal and splitting by locus. Assumes you've simulated two copies per lineage (i.e. alleles)

Need to change parameters in parameter block before running

alleles.R will give you two separate alleles per individual.
loci.R will give you just the first allele per individual.
